# OrbitRack
OrbitRack is a multi-tier rotating game disc and media organizer designed to store CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and game cases in a compact, circular layout. Instead of bulky square shelves, OrbitRack uses a 360° radial slot system that keeps discs neatly arranged around a rotating base — like planets orbiting around a hub.
